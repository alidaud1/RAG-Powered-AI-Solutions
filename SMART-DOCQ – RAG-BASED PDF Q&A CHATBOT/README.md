# MINDCARE AI â€“ RAG-BASED MENTAL HEALTH CHATBOT

## Project Overview

MINDCARE AI is an intelligent chatbot designed to answer specific queries derived from PDF documents. The project utilizes advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI to ensure contextually accurate and relevant responses. This README outlines the key components, processes, and technologies used in the development of the chatbot.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Query Response**: The chatbot can effectively answer questions based on content extracted from PDF documents.
- **Sentence Embeddings and Vector Search**: Utilizes sentence embeddings to convert text into numerical vectors, enabling efficient search and retrieval of relevant information.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Leverages the Gemini API to enhance response accuracy by generating contextually relevant answers based on the retrieved document content.
- **Document Preprocessing**: Implements techniques for preprocessing documents to optimize the input data for the model.
- **Text Chunking**: Divides large text documents into smaller, manageable chunks to facilitate effective querying and retrieval.
- **Efficient Embedding Techniques**: Ensures fast and relevant Q&A functionality by employing optimized embedding strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and processing human language.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database that enables high-performance vector search and retrieval.
- **Gemini API**: A generative AI service that provides contextually accurate responses based on retrieved content.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **PDF Processing Libraries**: Tools used for extracting text and data from PDF documents.

## Development Process

### 1. Document Preprocessing
- **Input**: Raw PDF documents containing relevant information.
- **Process**:
  - Extract text from PDF files using PDF processing libraries.
  - Clean and preprocess the text to remove any unnecessary characters and format inconsistencies.

### 2. Text Chunking
- **Input**: Preprocessed text from the documents.
- **Process**:
  - Split the text into smaller chunks (sentences or paragraphs) to improve retrieval efficiency.
  - Ensure each chunk is coherent and contextually complete.

### 3. Sentence Embedding and Vector Search
- **Input**: Text chunks.
- **Process**:
  - Convert each text chunk into a numerical vector using sentence embedding techniques.
  - Store the vectors in Pinecone for efficient searching.

### 4. Query Handling
- **Input**: User queries posed to the chatbot.
- **Process**:
  - Convert the user query into a vector using the same sentence embedding technique.
  - Use Pinecone to search for the most relevant document chunks based on the vectorized query.

### 5. Generative AI Integration
- **Input**: Retrieved document chunks.
- **Process**:
  - Pass the retrieved chunks to the Gemini API.
  - Generate contextually accurate responses to the user queries based on the document content.

### 6. User Interaction
- **Input**: User queries.
- **Output**: Contextual responses provided by the chatbot.
- **Process**:
  - Display responses to users in a user-friendly interface.

## Conclusion

MINDCARE AI represents a significant step forward in the realm of mental health support through technology. By utilizing sentence embeddings, vector search, and generative AI, the chatbot provides a robust solution for users seeking information from complex documents.
